    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page, task-oriented interactive explorer. The primary navigation is structured around high-level machine learning task categories (e.g., Classification, Regression, Clustering). This is more intuitive and efficient for a practitioner than a long, linear document. The user flow is as follows: 1) The user selects a task category from the main navigation. 2) The content area dynamically displays a grid of "metric cards" for that category. 3) Clicking a card opens a detailed modal view. This modal contains the metric's definition, its mathematical formula, an interactive visualization/example to build intuition, and a summary of its limitations. This "filter-then-detail" architecture breaks down the dense source material into manageable, easy-to-digest chunks, facilitating quick scanning and deep-dive exploration on demand, directly fulfilling the goal of making the content easily consumable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: To transform the static report into an interactive tool, the following choices were made: 1) **Structure**: The main layout, navigation, and metric cards are built with semantic HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS. 2) **Formulas**: Mathematical formulas are rendered using the KaTeX library for crisp, accurate display of LaTeX. 3) **Interactive Examples**: Instead of static examples, each metric features an interactive component powered by Chart.js and vanilla JavaScript. For Classification, users can manipulate a confusion matrix via input sliders and see how metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score change in real-time on a bar chart. For Regression, users can adjust data points on a scatter plot to see the immediate impact on MAE, MSE, and RMSE, visually demonstrating concepts like outlier sensitivity. For Clustering, a line chart illustrates the "Elbow Method". For K-Fold CV, a visual simulation shows data splitting. 4) **Justification**: This hands-on approach moves beyond passive reading to active learning, allowing users to build a deeper, more intuitive understanding of how each metric behaves. This directly addresses the "interactive storytelling" and "wow factor" requirements. 5) **Libraries**: Chart.js for all visualizations (bar, line, scatter), KaTeX for formulas, and vanilla JS for all state management and interaction logic. -->
